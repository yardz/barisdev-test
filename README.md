## Routes

component that manages as routes.
You should not have done it

Here, I request the data (json) and organize the photos in the respective albums and send them to the component (page). - It is not the function of this component but I did so because of the test

## /Pages/Albuns/AlbunsList.page.tsx

This component will select how many albums it will display, how many photos and what color the borders of the tables.

## /Components/AlbunsShow/AlbunsShow.tsx

This is a UI component.
It receives the photos and displays the images.
It would also be used on the page that shows all the photos in the album
